# Auto Counter
Remix to separate the pieces for easier printing.
Merged the inner piece into the bottom as it didn't need to be separate and aided glueing.
Also rounded the number holes for improved aesthetics.

I've printed 3 of these. I printed the top, bottom and cogs in 3 separate prints each time. 
The first counter was solid colour with a paint marker pen to colour around the numbers. 
The next 2 (pictured) were printed with changing filament just before the layer that put 
the backing on the numbers. If you've got the time and inclination, this came out very 
well & I highly recommend this method.
